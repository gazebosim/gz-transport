## Overview

This page contains instructions to install Ignition Transport on all the
support platforms including major Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows.

You can find all Ignition Transport versions at [https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/transport](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/transport).

# Binary Install

## Ubuntu

Setup your computer to accept software from
*packages.osrfoundation.org*:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
```

Setup keys:
```
wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

Install Ignition Transport:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libignition-transport<#>-dev
```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as `8` or `9`, depending on
which version you need.

## Mac OS X

Ignition Transport and several of its dependencies can be compiled on OS
X with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the [osrf/simulation
tap](https://github.com/osrf/homebrew-simulation). Ignition Transport is
straightforward to install on Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher.
Installation on older versions requires changing the default standard
library and rebuilding dependencies due to the use of c++11. For
purposes of this documentation, Assuming OS X 10.9 or greater is in
use. Here are the instructions:

Install homebrew, which should also prompt you to install the XCode
command-line tools:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Run the following commands:
```
brew tap osrf/simulation
brew install ignition-transport<#>
```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as `8` or `9`, depending on
which version you need.

## Windows

Install [Conda package management system](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html).
Miniconda suffices.

Create if necessary, and activate a Conda environment:
```
conda create -n ign-ws
conda activate ign-ws
```

Install:
```
conda install libignition-transport<#> --channel conda-forge
```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 1 or 2, depending on
which version you need.

# Source Install

## Ubuntu Linux

For compiling the latest version of Ignition Transport you will need an
Ubuntu distribution equal to 18.04 (Bionic) or newer.

Make sure you have removed the Ubuntu pre-compiled binaries before
installing from source:
```
sudo apt-get remove libignition-transport.*-dev
```

Install prerequisites. A clean Ubuntu system will need:
```
sudo apt-get install git cmake pkg-config python ruby-ronn libprotoc-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler uuid-dev libzmq3-dev libignition-msgs-dev libignition-utils1-cli-dev
```

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport
```

Configure and build
```
cd ign-common
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Configure Ignition Transport (choose either method a or b below):

A.  Release mode (recommended): This will generate optimized code, but will not have
    debug symbols. Use this mode if you don't need to use [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) (advanced).
```
cmake ..
```

Note: You can use a custom install path to make it easier to switch
between source and debian installs:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/$USER/local ..
```

B. Debug mode: This will generate code with debug symbols. Ignition
Transport will run slower, but you'll be able to use GDB.
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

The output from `cmake ../` may generate a number of errors and warnings
about missing packages. You must install the missing packages that have
errors and re-run `cmake ../`. Make sure all the build errors are
resolved before continuing (they should be there from the earlier step
in which you installed prerequisites).

Make note of your install path, which is output from cmake and should
look something like:
```
-- Install path: /home/$USER/local
```

Build Ignition Transport:
```
make -j4
```

Install Ignition Transport:
```
sudo make install
```

If you decide to install gazebo in a local directory you'll need to
modify your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
```
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<install_path>/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Uninstalling Source-based Install

If you need to uninstall Ignition Transport or switch back to a
debian-based install when you currently have installed the library from
source, navigate to your source code directory's build folders and run
`make uninstall`:
```
cd /tmp/ign-transport/build
sudo make uninstall
```

## Windows

### Prerequisites

First, follow the [ign-cmake](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-cmake) tutorial for installing Conda, Visual Studio, CMake, etc., prerequisites, and creating a Conda environment.

Navigate to `condabin` if necessary to use the `conda` command (i.e., if Conda is not in your `PATH` environment variable. You can find the location of `condabin` in Anaconda Prompt, `where conda`).

Activate the Conda environment:
```
conda activate ign-ws
```

Install prerequisites:
```
conda install zeromq cppzmq --channel conda-forge
```

Install Ignition dependencies:

You can view available versions and their dependencies:
```
conda search libignition-transport* --channel conda-forge --info
```

Install dependencies, replacing `<#>` with the desired versions:
```
conda install libignition-cmake<#> libignition-msgs<#> libignition-tools<#> --channel conda-forge
```

#### Building from Source

1. Navigate to where you would like to build the library, and clone the repository.
  ```
  # Optionally, append `-b ign-transport#` (replace # with a number) to check out a specific version
  git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport.git
  ```

2. Configure and build
  ```
  cd ign-transport
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF  # Optionally, -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path\to\install
  cmake --build . --config Release
  ```

3. Optionally, install. You will likely need to run a terminal with admin privileges for this call to succeed.
  ```
  cmake --install . --config Release
  ```

4. Optionally, build the examples

  If you installed to a custom location, you may need to specify ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, pointing to the directory containing the file ``ignition-transport<#>-config.cmake``.
  That file is installed to the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, for example, ``path\to\install\ignition-transport<#>\lib\cmake\ignition-transport<#>``.
  ```
  cd ign-transport\example
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..  # Optionally, -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path\to\cmake\config
  cmake --build . --config Release
  ```

  Try an example
  ```
  responser
  ```

  In another terminal, run
  ```
  requester
  ```

# Documentation

Visit the [documentation page](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/transport/10.0/index.html).

## Build documentation
```
cd build
make doc
```

Upload documentation to ignitionrobotics.org.
```
cd build
sh upload.sh
```

If you're creating a new release, then tell ignitionrobotics.org about
   the new version. For example:
```
curl -k -X POST -d '{"libName":"transport", "version":"1.0.0", "releaseDate":"2017-10-09T12:10:13+02:00","password":"secret"}' http      s://api.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/versions
```

# Testing

Tests can be run by building the `test` target. From your build directory you
can run:
```
make test
```
