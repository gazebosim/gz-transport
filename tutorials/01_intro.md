## What is Gazebo Transport?

Gazebo Transport is an open source communication library that allows sharing
data between clients. In our context, a client is called a node. Nodes might
be running within the same process on the same machine or on separate machines located
around the world. Gazebo Transport is multi-platform (Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows), so all the low level details, such as data alignment or endianness, are
hidden for you.

Gazebo Transport uses [Google Protocol buffers]
(https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/?hl=en) as the data type for
communicating between nodes. Users can define their own messages using the
Protobuf utils, and then exchange them between the nodes. Gazebo Transport
discovers, serializes and delivers messages to the destinations using a
combination of custom code and [ZeroMQ] (http://zeromq.org/).

## What programming language can I use with Gazebo Transport?

C++ is the native implementation and so far the only way to use the library.
We hope to offer different wrappers for the most popular languages in the future.
