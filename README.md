## Continuous integration

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ignition-transport/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ignition-transport/?badge=latest)


## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to compile ignition-transport from
source:

 - uuid-dev
 - libzmq3-dev
 - libprotobuf-dev
 - protobuf-compiler
 - cmake
 - ruby-ronn
 - git
 - C++ compiler with c++11 support (eg. GCC>=4.8).

    sudo apt-get install build-essential uuid-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libzmq3-dev cmake ruby-ronn git

**Note:** *if you are using an Ubuntu platform previous to Saucy, you will need to install zeromq from source, since there is no libzmq3-dev. Aternatively, you can use debian package
available at the Open Source Robotics Foundation.*

1. Setup your computer to accept software from packages.osrfoundation.org.

    ```
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-latest.list'
    ```

1. Setup keys.

    ```
    wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

1. Install libzmq3.

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libzmq3 libzmq3-dev
    ```

## Installation

Standard installation can be performed in UNIX systems using the following
steps:

 - mkdir build/
 - cd build/
 - cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
 - sudo make install

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the software installed with the previous steps:

 - cd build/
 - sudo make uninstall
