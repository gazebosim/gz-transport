# Features

Gazebo Transport is an open source communication library that allows
exchanging data between clients. In our context, a client is called a node.
Nodes might be running within the same process in the same machine or in
machines located in different continents. Gazebo Transport is multi-platform
(Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows), so all the low level details, such as data
alignment or endianness are hidden for you.

Gazebo Transport uses Google Protocol buffers as the data serialization format
for communicating between nodes. Users can define their own messages using the
Protobuf utils, and then, exchange them between the nodes. Gazebo Transport
discovers, serializes and delivers messages to the destinations using a
combination of custom code and ZeroMQ.

# Install

See the [installation tutorial](https://gazebosim.org/api/transport/11.0/installation.html).

# Usage

See [tutorials](https://gazebosim.org/api/transport/11.0/tutorials.html)
and the [example directory](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-transport/blob/main/example/)
in the source code.

## Known issue of command line tools

In the event that the installation is a mix of Debian and from source, command
line tools from `gz-tools` may not work correctly.

A workaround is to define the environment variable
`GZ_CONFIG_PATH` to point to the location of the Gazebo library installation,
where the YAML file for the package is found, such as
```
export GZ_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/share/gz
```

This issue is tracked [here](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-tools/issues/61).
