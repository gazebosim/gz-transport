# Features

Ignition Transport is an open source communication library that allows
exchanging data between clients. In our context, a client is called a node.
Nodes might be running within the same process in the same machine or in
machines located in different continents. Ignition Transport is multi-platform
(Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows), so all the low level details, such as data
alignment or endianness are hidden for you.

Ignition Transport uses Google Protocol buffers as the data serialization format
for communicating between nodes. Users can define their own messages using the
Protobuf utils, and then, exchange them between the nodes. Ignition Transport
discovers, serializes and delivers messages to the destinations using a
combination of custom code and ZeroMQ.

# Install

See the [installation tutorial](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/transport/10.0/installation.html).

# Usage

See [tutorials](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/transport/10.0/tutorials.html)
and the [example directory](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport/blob/main/example/)
in the source code.

## Known issue of command line tools

In the event that the installation is a mix of Debian and from source, command
line tools from `ign-tools` may not work correctly.

A workaround for a single package is to define the environment variable
`IGN_CONFIG_PATH` to point to the location of the Ignition library installation,
where the YAML file for the package is found, such as
```
export IGN_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/share/ignition
```

However, that environment variable only takes a single path, which means if the
installations from source are in different locations, only one can be specified.

Another workaround for working with multiple Ignition libraries on the command
line is using symbolic links to each library's YAML file.
```
mkdir ~/.ignition/tools/configs -p
cd ~/.ignition/tools/configs/
ln -s /usr/local/share/ignition/fuel4.yaml .
ln -s /usr/local/share/ignition/transport7.yaml .
ln -s /usr/local/share/ignition/transportlog7.yaml .
...
export IGN_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/.ignition/tools/configs
```

This issue is tracked [here](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-tools/issues/8).
