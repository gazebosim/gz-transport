Understanding nodes and topics
==============================

Nodes
=====

The communication in Ignition Transport follows a pure distributed architecture,
where there is no central process, broker or similar. All the nodes in the
network can act as publishers, subscribers, provide services and request
services.

A publisher is a node that produces information and a subscriber is a node that
consumes information. There are two categories or ways to communicate in
Ignition Transport. First, we could use a publish/subscribe approach, where a
node advertises a topic, and then, publishes periodic updates. On the other
side, one or more nodes subscribe to the same topic registering a function that
will be executed each time a new message is received. An alternative
communication paradigm is based on service calls. A service call is a remote
service that a node offers to the rest of the nodes. A node can request a
service in a similar way a local function is executed.

Topics
======

A topic is just a name for grouping a specific set of messages or a particular
service. Imagine that you have a camera and want to periodically publish its
images. Your node could advertise a topic called ``/image``, and then, publish a
new message on this topic every time a new image is available. Other nodes, will
subscribe to the same topic and will receive the messages containing the image.
A node could also offer an echo service in the topic ``/echo``. Any node
interested in this service will request a service call on topic ``/echo``. The
service call will accept arguments and will return a result. In our echo
service example, the result will be similar to the input parameter passed to the
service.

There are some rules to follow when selecting a topic name. It should be any
alphanumeric name followed by zero or more slashes. For example: ``/image``,
``head_position``, ``/robot1/joints/HeadPitch`` are examples of valid topic
names. The next table summarizes the allowed and not allowed topic rules.

*/*           Invalid   */* topic is not allowed
*~myTopic*    Invalid   Symbol *~* not allowed

Topic scope
===========

A topic can be optionally advertised with a scope. A scope allows you to set the
visibility of this topic. The available scopes are ``Process``, ``Host``, and
``All``. A ``Process`` scope means that the advertised topic will only be
visible in the nodes within the same process as the advertiser. A topic with a
``Host`` scope restricts the visibility of a topic to nodes located in the same
machine as the advertiser. Finally, by specifying a scope with an ``All`` value,
you're allowing your topic to be visible by any node.

Partition and namespaces
========================

When you create your node you can specify some options to customize its
behavior. Among those options you can set a partition name and a namespace.

A partition is used to isolate a set of topics or services within a group of
nodes that share the same partition name. E.g.: Node1 advertises topic ``/foo``
and Node2 advertises ``/foo`` too. If we don't use a partition, a node
subscribed to ``/foo`` will receive the messages published from Node1 and Node2.
Alternatively, we could specify ``p1`` as a partition for Node1 and ``p2`` as a
partition for Node2. When we create the node for our subscriber, if we specify
``p1`` as a partition name, we'll receive the messages published only by Node1.
If we use ``p2``, we'll only receive the messages published by Node2. If we
don't set a partition name, we won't receive any messages from Node1 or Node2.

A partition name is any alphanumeric string with a few exceptions.
The symbol ``/`` is allowed as part of a partition name but just ``/`` is
not allowed. The symbols ``@``, ``~`` or white spaces are not allowed as
part of a partition name. Two or more consecutive slashes (``//``) are not
allowed.

The default partition name is created using a combination of your hostname,
followed by ``:`` and your username. E.g.: ``bb9:caguero`` . It's also possible
to use the environment variable ``IGN_PARTITION`` for setting a custom partition
name.

A namespace is considered a prefix that might be potentially applied to some of
the topic/services advertised in a node.

E.g.: Node1 sets a namespace ``ns1`` and advertises the topics
``t1``, ``t2`` and ``/t3``. ``/t3`` is considered an absolute topic (starts
with ``/``) and it won't be affected by a namespace. However, ``t1`` and
``t2`` will be advertised as ``/ns1/t1`` and ``/ns1/t2``.

A namespace is any alphanumeric string with a few exceptions.
The symbol ``/`` is allowed as part of a namespace but just ``/`` is not
allowed. The symbols ``@``, ``~`` or white spaces are not allowed as
part of a namespace. Two or more consecutive slashes (``//``) are not allowed.
