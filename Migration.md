# Note on deprecations

A tick-tock release cycle allows easy migration to new software versions.
Obsolete code is marked as deprecated for one major release.
Deprecated code produces compile-time warnings. These warning serve as
notification to users that their code should be upgraded. The next major
release will remove the deprecated code.
