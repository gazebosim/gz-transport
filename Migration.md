# Note on deprecations

A tick-tock release cycle allows easy migration to new software versions.
Obsolete code is marked as deprecated for one major release.
Deprecated code produces compile-time warnings. These warning serve as
notification to users that their code should be upgraded. The next major
release will remove the deprecated code.

## Ignition Transport 7.X to 8.X

### Deprecated

1. NodeShared::TriggerSubscriberCallbacks
    * [BitBucket pull request 404](https://osrf-migration.github.io/ignition-gh-pages/#!/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport/pull-requests/404)

1. The discovery wire protocol changed to use gz::msgs::Discovery
   instead of C-structs. The Packet.hh header file is deprecated, which
   contained the Header, SubscriptionMsg, and AdvertiseMessage classes. The
   version of the wire protocal has bumped from 9 to 10. This means Ignition
   Transport 8+ will not work with Ignition Transport 7 and below.
